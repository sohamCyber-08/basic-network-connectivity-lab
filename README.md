# basic-network-connectivity-lab



## 📌 Overview

This lab demonstrates basic Layer 2 network connectivity using **EVE-NG, Cisco IOS, and VPCS**.

The lab focuses on IP addressing, ARP resolution, MAC address learning, Ethernet frame forwarding, and ICMP connectivity testing.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Configure IPv4 addressing on end devices
* Verify connectivity between two hosts
* Understand ARP-based IP-to-MAC resolution
* Verify MAC address learning on a switch
* Understand basic Ethernet frame forwarding
* Perform basic network troubleshooting

## 🖥️ Lab Environment

* EVE-NG
* Cisco IOS Switch
* VPCS
* Ethernet

## 🌐 Network Topology

## 📋 IP Addressing

| Device | IP Address    | Subnet Mask   | Default Gateway |
| ------ | ------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| PC1    | 192.168.10.1  | 255.255.255.0 | Not Required    |
| PC2    | 192.168.10.2  | 255.255.255.0 | Not Required    |

## ⚙️ Configuration

### PC1

```bash
ip 192.168.10.1/24
```

### PC2

```bash
ip 192.168.10.2/24
```

## 🔍 Verification


### Test connectivity

```bash
ping 192.168.10.1
```

### Check ARP table

```bash
show arp
```

### Check switch MAC address table

```cisco
show mac address-table
```

### Key Concepts Demonstrated

* IPv4 addressing
* Subnetting
* ARP
* MAC address learning
* Ethernet switching
* ICMP
* Basic network troubleshooting

## 🧠 Key Learning

This lab provided practical understanding of how a host resolves a destination IP address to a MAC address using ARP and how a Layer 2 switch uses its MAC address table to forward Ethernet frames.
